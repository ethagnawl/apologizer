# Apologizer

## Summary
Apologizer is a Telegram bot which allows members of a group chat to
apologize to each other via an automated telephone call, which uses
text-to-speech to provide a personalized message.

 I wanted to experiment with the Telegram bot API/ecosystem and this was the
 quickest and cutest proof-of-concept I could come up with. I was able to get
 a bot built and deployed in less than an hour and the documentation and
 examples found on core.telegram.org were clear, concise and very helpful.
 I've decommissioned the bot and probably won't ever use it again, but it
 worked exactly as expected and I'll consider this experiment a success.
